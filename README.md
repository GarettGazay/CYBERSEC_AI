# AI Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of AI-driven cybersecurity projects! This repository showcases my work as I transition into a career as a cybersecurity professional, leveraging my self-taught expertise in Python and a passion for solving complex problems with modern machine learning techniques.

## About Me

I’m currently enrolled in the "Introduction to AI for Cybersecurity" course offered by Johns Hopkins University through Coursera, sharpening my skills in applying AI to real-world security challenges. Originally self-taught in Python, I honed a strong focus on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Learning (DL) to tackle transportation problems—optimizing scheduling and efficiency. Recently, I’ve shifted my focus to cybersecurity, finding it more aligned with my personal goals as an engineer: building robust, impactful solutions that protect systems and data.

My technical toolkit includes:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Django REST Framework
- **Tools**: Docker, Jupyter, Git
- **AI/ML**: RL (e.g., PPO), DL (PyTorch), NLP (NLTK), scikit-learn
- **Focus**: Efficient, scalable solutions for cybersecurity

I’m seeking a position as a cybersecurity professional where I can apply my AI skills to detect and mitigate threats, blending my problem-solving background with cutting-edge technology.

## Projects

The `notebooks/` folder contains my current projects, developed as part of my coursework and personal exploration:

### Phishing/Spam Email Detector (`notebooks/Spam_Phishing_Detector_NLTK.ipynb`)
- **Description**: A lightweight spam/phishing detector built with NLTK and Naive Bayes, achieving 97.49% accuracy and 90.14% F1 score for spam detection on the SMS Spam Collection dataset.
- **Why**: Demonstrates text preprocessing and efficient classification—key for cybersecurity—while setting the stage for future RL/DL enhancements.
- **Tech**: Python, NLTK, scikit-learn, Jupyter

More projects (e.g., RL-driven authentication tools) are in progress as I deepen my cybersecurity expertise.

## Goals

This portfolio reflects my journey from transportation-focused RL/DL to AI-powered cybersecurity. My work emphasizes practical, results-driven solutions—whether optimizing schedules or catching threats—using Python and JavaScript, with Docker for deployment and Django REST Framework for API development. I’m excited to bring this blend of skills to a cybersecurity role, contributing to innovative threat detection and prevention.
